This is the final Final completed project of the course on carla simulator.
Waypoints were provided to the vehicle along which it needs to travel. A controller was designed and implemented to make the vehicle follow the required waypoints.

1. Longitudinal Control was implemented using the PID control and
2. Stanley Controller is used for the lateral control.
